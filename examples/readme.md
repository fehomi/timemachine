### Examples

#### Absolute hydration free energy

`ahfe.py` runs 4D decoupling simulations of aspirin in a waterbox, for later use in a TI estimator of the absolute hydration free energy.

#### Relative hydration free energy

`rhfe.py` runs 4D decoupling simulations of aspirin and a version of aspirin that mutates an oxygen to a fluorine in a waterbox, subject to a centroid restraint, for later use in a TI estimator of the relative hydration free energy difference between these two compounds.

#### Testing overlap

`overlap_test.py` tests two restraint types, one based on principal moments of inertia and one based on a measure of shape overlap.
